Since this app is under heavy development and the documentation can become outdated, please refer to the Swagger
documentation available at the `/docs` endpoint of the running application or
the `/openapi.json` endpoint for the raw OpenAPI specification.

> [NLGov REST API Design Rules](https://gitdocumentatie.logius.nl/publicatie/api/adr/) because they are still 'under construction'.
